## Introduction

Alimonio is a streamlined mobile  recipe browsing app built and designed using Flutter. The aim was to create an app that would allow the user to search for any recipes that fit their own dietary restrictions. Or any specific ingredient they may be looking for. On top of this, Alimonio also has a feature that will take the user’s ‘craving’ and then provide them with a list of products that they are likely to find at their local grocery store. 

## Running Alimonio Locally

*Alimonio does use an API that requires an API key. As such, in order to run the app, you would need to get your own API key and save it in a `.env` file with the variable name __API_KEY__*

**Caution: This API does have a request limit with which you will be charged for going over that limit**

## API

 [**Spoonacular**](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/yummly-api-replacement) - Alimonio uses to the Spoonacular API in order to provide the user with various recipes and ingredients.
